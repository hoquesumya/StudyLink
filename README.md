## Welcome to StudyLink app
StudyLink is an app designed to help students easily make study buddies with peers from their university classes. By offering a way to find fellow classmates and reach out, StudyLink reduces the anxiety of asking for help in large lectures and creates a more personal and approachable environment for students who want to practice, collaborate, or seek help in their courses. Using the Canvas API, StudyLink automates the process of pulling student enrollment data and course information, making it effortless for students to discover peers in their classes for collaboration and study sessions.
Some examples of the tasks StudyLink addresses are:
- Automatically listing all of the courses in which a student is enrolled
- After selecting a class, students can see a list of classmates who are also using the app. 
- Syncing with course materials and assignments, allows students to specify which assignments, lectures, or projects the students want to discuss or collaborate on.
- Providing class-specific schedules and deadlines, helping students organize study sessions around important course events like exams and project deadlines.
- Facilitating communication between students via in-app messaging, uni email, or external messaging services 

StudyLink is a cloud-based app that delivers a significant improvement in how students connect for academic collaboration, making it easier to form study groups and engage with peers. The value to students is increased access to study support and reduced anxiety in large, impersonal lecture settings. The benefit to universities is that StudyLink fosters a more supported, connected, and collaborative student body.
